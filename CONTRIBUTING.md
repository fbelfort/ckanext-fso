How to contribute
=================

If you want to submit a Pull Request (PR), make sure you are using the latest `develop` branch.
All PRs should be opened for the `develop` branch, as that's the place where the current development takes place.

From time to time we will create a release, which basically is a merge from `develop` to `master`.
Releases are meant to be deployed on a server, therefore code in `master` is considered stable.
